# Discovery Questions

The following questions will help understand the scope and context of the feedback database/API disconnect issue.

## Q1: Is this issue affecting the production deployment currently live for users?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (data issues typically need immediate production fixes)

## Q2: Should the cache refresh process run automatically without manual intervention?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (automation prevents future data synchronization issues)

## Q3: Do all 5,000+ records need to be immediately available after the fix?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users expect complete data access once the issue is resolved)

## Q4: Should the system gracefully handle partial Airtable failures or network issues?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (robust error handling prevents future data loss scenarios)

## Q5: Do users need real-time updates when new records are added to Airtable?
**Default if unknown:** No (batch synchronization is typically sufficient for feedback data)
