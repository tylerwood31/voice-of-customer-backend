# Initial Request

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-26 14:59

**Request:** Feedback Database/API Disconnect - There should be over 5,000 records. Not just 7. We want all records from 2025 from Airtable.

## Problem Description
The feedback API is only returning 7 records instead of the expected 5,000+ records from 2025 that should be available in Airtable. This represents a significant data disconnect between the Airtable source and the application's database/API.

## Expected Outcome
- All 2025 records from Airtable should be available through the feedback API
- Users should see 5,000+ records instead of just 7
- Data synchronization between Airtable and the application database should be working correctly
